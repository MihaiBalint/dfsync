### ðŸ“ˆ Command-line usages Example
##### Example Usages:
1. Watch src directory and sync changes to a destination on the local file system.
   ```bash
     $ dfsync [src] [destination]
     # OR
     $ dfsync [destination] # Current directory will be treated as [src]
   ```
     ```bash
        $ dfsync src /home/user/absolute/path/to/target/dir # sync src directory to destination.
                Destination, rsync: '/home/user/Desktop/'
                Watching dir(s): 'dist/'; press [Ctrl-C] to exit
        $ dfsync . ../../relative/path/to/target/dir  # Sync current directory (.) into relatively mentioned path.
                Destination, rsync: '../../Desktop/'
                Watching dir(s): '.'; press [Ctrl-C] to exit
        $ dfsync ../../relative/path/to/target/dir # if source directory is omitted, current directory is considered at src directory.
     ```
2. Watch [src] [dir] and sync changes to a remote target using ssh
   ```bash
      $ dfsync src user@target-host:/home/user/absolute/paths/to/remote/host/dir # [src] to [dest] absolute directory.
      # OR
      $ dfsync build user@target-host:~/relative/path/to/user/home # [src=build] to [relative path]
   ```
3. Watch a directory [src] and sync changes to kubernetes pod/containers using the given image name
   ```bash
     $ dfsync src kube://image-name-of-awesome-api:/home/user/awesome-api # 
      # OR
     $ dfsync kube://quay.io/project/name-of-container-image:/home/path/within/container/awesome-api
    ```

### ðŸ‘€ Command-line Reference
```bash
$ dfsync --help
Usage: dfsync [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]... [DESTINATION]

  Watches a folder for changes and propagates all file changes to a
  destination.

  SOURCE is a path to the folder that dfsync will monitor for changes (or
  current dir if missing)

  DESTINATION is a destination path / psuedo-url

  Example usages:

  1. Watch a dir and sync changes to a target on the local filesystem
     dfsync src /home/user/absolute/paths/to/target/dir
     dfsync . ../../relative/path/to/target/dir
     dfsync ../../relative/path/to/target/dir (if source_dir is omitted, will watch the current dir)

  2. Watch a dir and sync changes to a remote target using ssh
     dfsync src user@target-host:/home/user/absolute/paths/to/remote/host/dir
     dfsync build user@target-host:~/relative/path/to/user/home

  3. Watch a dir and sync changes to kubernetes pod/containers using the given image name
     dfsync src kube://image-name-of-awesome-api:/home/user/awesome-api
     dfsync kube://quay.io/project/name-of-container-image:/home/path/within/container/awesome-api

  dfsync is:
  * git-aware: changes to git internals, files matching .gitignore patterns and untracked files will be ignored
  * editor-aware: changes to temporary files created by source code editors will be ignored
  * transparent: every action is diligently logged in the console

Options:
  --supervisor / --no-supervisor  Try to install supervisor in container
  --kube-host TEXT                Kubernetes api host server address/hostname
  --pod-timeout INTEGER           Pod reconfiguration timeout (default is 30
                                  seconds)

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
